<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>On the completion of the work of excavation and repair of Cliff
Palace, in the Mesa Verde National Park, in southern Colorado, in
charge of the writer, under the Secretary of the Interior, he was
instructed by Mr. W. H. Holmes, then Chief of the Bureau of
American Ethnology, to make an archeologic reconnaissance of the
northern part of Arizona, where a tract of land containing important
prehistoric ruins had been reserved by the President under
the name Navaho National Monument. In the following pages are
considered some of the results of that trip, a more detailed account
of the ruins being deferred to a future report, after a more extended
examination shall have been made.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Mention is made of a few objects
collected, and recommendations are submitted for future excavation
and repair work on these remarkable ruins to preserve them for
examination by students and tourists. As will appear later, a scientific
study of them is important, for they are connected with Hopi
pueblos still inhabited, in which are preserved traditions concerning
the ruins and their ancient inhabitants.</p>

<p>The present population of Walpi, a Hopi pueblo, is made up of
descendants of various clans, whose ancestors once lived in distant
villages, now ruins, situated in various directions from its site on
the East mesa. One of the problems before the student of the Pueblos
is to locate accurately the ancestral villages where these clans lived
in prehistoric times. From an examination of the architecture of
these villages and a study of the character of secular and cult objects
found in them, the culture of the clans that inhabited these dwellings
could be roughly determined. The culture at any epoch in the history
of the clan being known, data are available that may make possible
comparison and correlation with that which is still more ancient:
in other words, that may add a chapter to our knowledge of the
migrations of the Hopi Indians in prehistoric times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>The writer has already identified some of the ancient houses of
those Hopi clans that claim to have dwelt formerly south of Walpi,
on the Little Colorado near Winslow, but has not investigated the
ruins to the north, in which once lived the Snake, Horn, and Flute
clans. An investigation of the origin and migrations of this contingent
is instructive because it is claimed that these clans were
among the first to arrive at Walpi, or that they united with the
previously existing Bear clan, forming the nucleus of the population
of that pueblo.</p>

<p>A preliminary step in the investigation of the culture of the clans
that played a most important part in founding Walpi and giving rise
to the Hopi people would be the identification of the houses (now
ruins) of the Snake, Horn, and Flute clans, the existence of which
in the region north of Walpi is known with a greater or less degree of
certainty from Hopi legends. An archeologic study of these ruins
and of cult objects found in them would reveal some of the prehistoric
features of the culture of the ancient Snake clans. “The
ancient home of my ancestors,” said the old Snake chief to the writer,
“was called Tokónabi,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> which is situated not far from Navaho mountain.
If you go there, you will find ruins of their former houses.”
In previous years the writer had often looked with longing eyes to
the mountains that formed the Hopi horizon on the north where these
mysterious homes of the Snake and Flute clans were said to be
situated, but had never been able to explore them. In 1909 the
opportunity came to visit this region, and while some of the ruins
found may not be identifiable with Tokónabi, they were abodes of
people almost identical in culture with the ancient Snake, Horn,
and Flute clans of the Hopi.</p>

<p>References to the northern ruins occur frequently in Hopi legends
of the Snake and Flute clans, and even accounts of the great natural
bridges lately seen for the first time by white people were given years
ago by Hopi familiar with legends of these families. The writer heard
the Hopi tell of their former homes among the “high rocks” in the
north and at Navaho mountain, fifteen years ago, at which time
they offered to guide him to them. The stories of the great cave ruins
to the north were heard even earlier from the lips of the Hopi
priests by another observer. Mr. A. M. Stephen, the pioneer in Hopi
studies, informed the writer that he had learned of great ruins in the
north as far back as 1885, and Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff, aided by Mr.
Stephen, published the names of the clans which, according to the
Hopi, inhabited them.</p>

<p>Victor Mindeleff<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> summarizes the Hopi traditions concerning Tokónabi
still preserved by the Horn and Flute clans of Walpi:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Horn people, to which the Lenbaki [Flute] belonged, have a legend of coming
from a mountain range in the east.</p>

<p>Its peaks were always snow covered, and the trees were always green. From the
hillside the plains were seen, over which roamed the deer, the antelope, and the
bison, feeding on never-failing grasses. [Possibly the Horn people were so called
from an ancient home where horned animals abounded.] Twining through these
plains were streams of bright water, beautiful to look upon. A place where none but
those who were of our people ever gained access.</p>

<p>This description suggests some region of the headwaters of the Rio Grande. Like
the Snake people, they tell of a protracted migration, not of continuous travel, for
they remained for many seasons in one place, where they would plant and build permanent
houses. One of these halting places is described as a canyon with high, steep
walls, in which was a flowing stream; this, it is said, was the Tségi (the Navajo name
for Canyon de Chelly).<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Here they built a large house in a cavernous recess, high
up in the canyon wall. They tell of devoting two years to ladder making and
cutting and pecking shallow holes up the steep rocky side by which to mount to the
cavern, and three years more were employed in building the house....</p>

<p>The legend goes on to tell that after they had lived there for a long time a stranger
happened to stray in their vicinity, who proved to be a Hopituh [Hopi], and said
that he lived in the south. After some stay he left and was accompanied by a party
of the “Horn” [clan], who were to visit the land occupied by their kindred Hopituh
and return with an account of them; but they never came back. After waiting a
long time another band was sent, who returned and said that the first emissaries had
found wives and had built houses on the brink of a beautiful canyon, not far from the
other Hopituh dwellings. After this many of the Horns grew dissatisfied with their
cavern home, dissensions arose, they left their home and finally they reached Tusayan.</p>
</div>

<p>The early legends of the Snake clans tell how bags containing
their ancestors were dropped from a rainbow in the neighborhood of
Navaho mountain. They recount how they built a pentagonal home
and how one of their young men married a Snake girl who gave birth
to reptiles, which bit the children and compelled the people to migrate.
They left their canyon homes and went southward, building houses
at the stopping-places all the way from Navaho mountain to Walpi.
Some of these houses, probably referring to their <em>kivas</em> and <em>kihus</em>,
legends declare, were round<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and others square.</p>

<p>Some of the ruins here mentioned have been known to white men
for many years. There is evidence that they have been repeatedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
visited by soldiers, prospectors, and relic hunters. The earliest
white visitor of whom there is any record was Lieutenant Bell, of
the 2d (?) Infantry, U. S. A.,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> whose name, with the date 1859, is still
to be seen cut on a stone in a wall of ruin A.</p>

<p>A few years ago information was obtained from Navaho by Richard
and John Wetherill of the existence of some of the large cliff-houses
on Laguna creek and its branches; the latter has guided several parties
to them. Among other visitors in 1909 may be mentioned Dr.
Edgar L. Hewett, director of the School of American Archæology
of the Archæological Institute of America. A party<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> from the
University of Utah, under direction of Prof. Byron Cummings, has
dug extensively in the ruins and obtained a considerable collection.</p>

<p>The sites of several ruins in the Navaho National Monument,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
which was created on his recommendation, have been indicated by
Mr. William B. Douglass, United States Examiner of Surveys, General
Land Office, on a map accompanying the President’s proclamation,
and also on a recent map issued by the General Land Office.
Although his report has not yet been published, he has collected considerable
data, including photographs of Betatakin, Kitsiel (Keetseel),
and the ruin called Inscription House, situated in the Nitsi (Neetsee)
canyon. While Mr. Douglass does not claim to be the discoverer of
these ruins, credit is due him for directing the attention of the Interior
Department to the antiquities of this region and the desirability
of preserving them.</p>

<p>The two ruins<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> in Nitsi (Neetsee),<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> West canyon, are not yet
included in the Navaho Monument, but according to Mr. Douglass
these are large ones, being 300 and 350 feet long, respectively,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and
promise a rich field for investigation. That these ruins will yield
large collections is indicated by the fact that the several specimens of
minor antiquities in a collection presented to the Smithsonian Institution
by Mr. Janus, the best of which are here figured (pls. <a href="#i065-1">15-18</a>),
came from this neighborhood, possibly from one of these ruins.</p>

<br>

<p>The ruins in West canyon (pl. <a href="#i014">2</a>) are particularly interesting from
the fact that the walls of some of the rooms are built of elongated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>cylinders of clay shaped like a Vienna loaf of bread. These
“bricks” consist of a bundle of twigs enveloped in red clay,
which forms a superficial covering, the “brick” being flattened on
two faces. These unusual adobes were laid like bricks, and so tenaciously
were they held together by clay mortar that in one instance
the corner of a room, on account of undermining, had fallen as a single
mass. The use of straw-strengthened adobe blocks is unknown
in the construction of other cliff-houses, although the author’s
investigations at Cliff Palace in Mesa Verde National Park revealed
the use of cubical clay blocks not having the central core of twigs or
sticks, and true adobes are found in the Chelly canyon and at
Awatobi. The ruins in West canyon can be visited from either
Bekishibito or Shanto, the approach from both of these places being
not difficult. There is good drinking water in West canyon, where
may be found also small areas of pasturage owned by a few Navaho
who inhabit this region. The trail by which one descends from the
rim of West canyon to the valley is steep and difficult.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting discoveries in West canyon is the
grove of peach trees in the valley a short distance from the canyon
wall. The existence of these trees indicates Spanish influence. Peach
trees were introduced into the Hopi country and the Canyon de
Chelly in historic times either by Spanish priests or by refugees from
the Rio Grande pueblos. They were observed in the Chelly canyon
by Simpson in 1850.</p>

<p>The geographical position of these ruins in relation to Navaho
mountain<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> leads the writer to believe that they might have been
built by the Snake clans in their migration south and west from
Tokónabi to Wukóki, but he has not yet been able to identify them
by Hopi traditions.</p>

<p>But little has appeared in print on the ruins near Marsh pass.
In former times an old government road, now seldom used, ran
through Marsh pass, and those who traveled over it had a good view
of some of these ruins. Situated far from civilization, this region has
attracted but slight attention, although it is one of the most important,
archeologically speaking, in our Southwest. Much of this part
of Arizona is covered with ruins, some of which, as “Tecolote,”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> are
indicated on the United States Engineers’ map of 1877. In his
excellent article<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> on this region Dr. T. Mitchell Prudden gives us no
description of the interesting cliff-dwellings in or near Marsh pass,
though he writes of the ruins in the neighboring canyon: “There are
numerous small valley sites, several cliff houses, and a few pictographs
in the canyon of the Towanache,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> which enters Marsh pass
from the northwest.” As indicated on his map, Doctor Prudden’s
route did not pass the large ruins west and south of this canyon or
those on the road to Red Lake and Tuba.</p>

<p>Manifestly, the purpose of a national monument is the preservation
of important objects contained therein, and a primary object
of archeological work should be to attract to it as many visitors and
students as possible. As the country in which the Navaho National
Monument is situated is one of the least known parts of Arizona,
first place will be given to a brief account of one of the routes by
which the important ruins included in the reserve may be reached.</p>

is now called Canyon de Chelly, but to Laguna canyon, likewise bordered by high cliffs, which the
Navaho also designate <em>Tségi</em>. The designation Canyon de Chelly was used by Simpson in 1850 (Sen. Ex.
Doc. no. 64, 31st Cong., 1st sess.), who wrote (p. 69, footnote): “The orthography of this word I got from

</div>

<p>Three routes to the Monument have been used by visitors, namely:
(1) that from Bluff, Utah, by way of Oljato or Moonwater canyon; (2)
that from Gallup, New Mexico, via the Chin Lee valley, and (3)
that from Flagstaff, via Tuba and the Moenkopi wash. The disadvantages
of the first route, that used by most visitors, are the isolation
of Bluff from railroads, the treacherous character of the San
Juan river, which must be crossed, and the rugged country near
Marsh pass. From the Gallup road it would be possible to go
through the Canyon de Chelly in full view of many of its greatest
cliff-dwellings, and while facilities for outfitting and purchasing
supplies along the route are not of the best, this route has its advantages.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Route from Flagstaff to Marsh Pass</span></h3>

<p>The writer outfitted at Flagstaff, Arizona, and, following the “Tuba
road,” forded the Little Colorado at Tanners crossing, and continued
on to Tuba, a Navaho Indian agency situated near the Moenkopi
wash, where there is a trading place at which provisions can be
had. The road from Flagstaff to Tuba is well traveled, its sole drawback
being the ford of the river, the bottom of which at times is
treacherous. Immediately after leaving Flagstaff this route passes
through a pine forest, which offers many attractive camping
places and where water can always be obtained. For the greater
part of the distance Sunset and O’Leary peaks are in full view and the
beautiful San Francisco mountains are likewise conspicuous. After
crossing Deadmans flat the road descends to Indian Tanks, situated
near the lower limit of the cedar trees; here is a fairly good camping
place where water is generally available. From this camp to Halfway
House<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> one crosses a semiarid desert, where wood and water
are hard to find.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>One of the most interesting landmarks visible from the road, after
leaving Indian Tanks, is called Superstition mountain, an elevation
situated to the north. According to Navaho stories, phantom fires
are sometimes seen on this mountain on dark nights, recalling an
incident, mentioned in the Snake legend, which occurred when the
Snake clans came south in their early migration from Tokónabi.
This legend states that all this land once belonged to their Fire God,
Masauû, who was likewise god of the surface of the earth. Lights
moving around the mesas are said to have been seen by these ancient
inhabitants much as they are now ascribed to Superstition mountain.</p>

<p>The traveler over the recent lava beds and cinder plains in the
neighborhood of the San Francisco mountains can readily accept the
statement that the early Hopi saw flames issuing from the earth or
the glow of hot lava, which gave substance to the legend still preserved
among this people. It was so natural for them to regard such a
country as the property of their Fire God that their legends state
they inherited the land from him.</p>

<p>The legends of the Snake clans recount also that when their
ancestors migrated from Tokónabi they went south and west until
they reached the Little Colorado river, where they built many houses
of stone. They remained there several years, but later left these
houses and continued in an easterly direction to Walpi. Where are
the ruins of these ancient houses of the Snake clans on the Little
Colorado? There are several Little Colorado ruins, as Homolobi
near Winslow, but Hopi traditions affirm these were built by people
who came from the south. Lower down the river at the Great Falls
are other ruins, but these likewise are ascribed to southern clans.
The cluster of stone buildings near the Black Falls conforms in position
and direction from Walpi to Hopi legends of the site of Wukóki,
the Great Houses built by Snake clans before they went to Walpi.
In their migration from Tokónabi, probably the Snake people tarried
here and built houses, and then went on to the Bear settlements or
the Hopi pueblos, where their descendants now live. More extensive
archeologic work on these ruins may shed additional light on this
identification, and it is interesting to compare in point of architecture
the buildings at Black Falls<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> with those of extreme northern Arizona.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>An obscure trail branches from the Tuba road to the Black Falls
ruins just beyond the cedars below Indian Tanks, and the black walls
of the so-called “citadel” of this cluster are conspicuous for a considerable
distance before one leaves the main road. The ruin here
figured is some distance beyond the “citadel” and is hidden from view
by intervening hills and mesas, but from the time the traveler crosses
the valley of the Little Colorado and goes down into the Moenkopi
wash he follows approximately the old trail the Snake people took in
their southerly migration from Tokónabi.</p>

<p>Near Tanners crossing on the left bank, a short distance down the
river, Mr. Janus<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> has cemented a small basin above the highest level
of the flood, into which always flows pure water. The road from the
river to Moenkopi wash passes through a region where there is very
little wood for camping and no water. The distance from Flagstaff
to Tuba, about 90 miles, may be traveled in two days by taking the
midday meal of the first day at Indian Tanks and camping the first
night at Halfway House, where there is water for horses.</p>

<p>The pueblo settlement of Moenkopi (“place of the running water”),
which lies not far from Tuba, will give the visitor a fair idea of a small
Hopi pueblo. This settlement is said to be comparatively modern
and to have been made by colonists from Oraibi, but there are reasons
to believe that it dates back to the middle of the eighteenth century.
The pueblo is inhabited mainly by Pakab (Reed) clans, a people of
late advent in the Hopi country, whose arrival therein was subsequent,
at all events, to that of the Snake clans. The houses of Moenkopi are
arranged in rows, and it has one ceremonial room, or kiva, not unlike
the kivas of Walpi. None of the great nine-days ceremonies of the
Hopi is performed at Moenkopi; such dances as exist, called <em>katcinas</em>,
are conducted by masked participants. Possibly the presence of
Pakab clans in this pueblo is accounted for by need of warriors in its
exposed position, for the chief of the Hopi Warrior society (at Walpi)
belongs to the Pakab clan. The ruins about Moenkopi are small and
inconspicuous, but those between this pueblo and Oraibi are of
considerable size.</p>

<br>

<p>Beyond Tuba the road is rough, running over upturned strata of
rocks and extending along sandy stretches of plain and hills to Red
Lake, where there is an Indian trading store owned by well-known
merchants of Flagstaff.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Here also provisions may be obtained for
the trip and abundant water for stock. The road now becomes more
difficult. Just after leaving Red Lake there may be noticed to the
left two great pinnacles of rock called Elephant Legs, not unlike those
in Monument canyon, Utah, and far to the north the cliffs are fantastically
eroded. The White Mesa natural bridge, visible from Red
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>Lake, is one of the scenic features of this locality. There are prehistoric
burials in the sands near Red Lake, from which have been
obtained several beautiful specimens of pottery resembling in the
main those from the Navaho National Monument and from the Black
Falls ruins.</p>

<p>The road continues from Red Lake to Bekishibito (Cow Spring),<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
where the water issues from under a low cliff, spreading in the wet
season over the adjacent plain and forming a shallow lake several
miles long, whose bottom is somewhat dangerous on account of
quicksands. When there is water a rich mantle of grass—a boon to
travelers in this dusty land—covers the plain, making an attractive
camping place. This stretch of the road, not more than 20 miles in
length, is fairly good and easily traversed by wagons.</p>

<p>After leaving Bekishibito, the road to Marsh pass, although on the
whole not bad, becomes more and more obscure. The traveler now
enters the region of ruins, and passes several mounds indicating
former habitations, some of which still have standing walls. Several
pools of water, reduced to little more than mudholes, are found along
the road, but a constant supply of potable water is found at the
sand hills in the Black mesa opposite the butte called by the Navaho
Saunee, 30 to 40 miles distant from Cow Spring. The distance
from Red Lake to this camp is a good day’s journey with a heavily
loaded buckboard, noon camp being made at Bekishibito. From
Saunee one can easily reach Marsh pass in another day, making in
all five “sleeps” from Flagstaff to Marsh pass. The only serious
difficulties on the route are encountered as one ascends the pass,
but a few weeks’ work here would make the whole road from Tuba
to Marsh pass as good as that from Flagstaff to Tuba, which is
considered one of the best in this part of Arizona.</p>

<p>A large ruin with high walls is visible on a promontory of the
Sethlagini plateau westward from this camp. This ruin, as well
as another near the road, about halfway from the sand hills to
Bekishibito, was not studied; the latter, which lies only a short distance
from the road, on a low rocky hill, was visited and found to
be the remains of a small pueblo, more or less dilapidated but with
standing walls. The fragments of pottery in this vicinity are not
unlike those found at the Black Falls ruins, and the masonry of the
ruin is almost identical in character. At the time of the writer’s
visit there was a pool of water, not very inviting even to horses, a
few hundred feet from this ancient habitation. Numerous sheep
pasturing in the neighborhood befoul this pool, so that it can not be
depended on to supply the needs of either men or horses. The road
(plate <a href="#i014">2</a>) follows the valley west of the great Sethlagini mesa, over a
hill and finally down again to a Navaho cornfield, the owner of which
served as a guide to the large ruin A.</p>

Marsh pass, beyond Red Lake.</p>

<p>The architecture of the ruins on the Little Colorado near Black Falls resembles that of the open ruins,
especially Ruin A, and those near the road from Bekishibito to Marsh pass. While great weight can not be
given to this resemblance, since we find much uniformity in stone ruins everywhere in the Southwest, it is
interesting to take in connection with this fact the close likeness in minor objects from the Laguna Creek
ruins and the Black Falls cluster. The prevailing ware from both is the gray pottery with black geometrical
ornamentation and red ware with black or brown decoration. The red ware and the yellow ware, so
abundant higher up the river, are not the prevailing kinds. The pottery of the Black Falls ruins is essentially
the same type as that of the San Juan and its tributaries.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ruin A</span></h3>

<p>The first ruin of considerable size that was visited is situated to the
left of and somewhat distant from the road, a few miles west and
south of Marsh pass. As this ruin (pl. <a href="#i021-1">4</a>)<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> stands on an elevation,
it is visible for a considerable distance across the valley, especially
to one approaching it from the southwest. The standing walls rise
in places to a height of 10 feet, showing indications of two stories,
some of the rafters in places still projecting beyond the face of the
wall. The two walls highest and most prominent are parallel,
inclosing a long room or court; in one place a break has been made
through these walls, as appears in the illustration. The remnants or
foundations of other walls back of these show that ruin A was
formerly very much larger than the walls now standing would
indicate.</p>

<p>The walls are composed of roughly laid masonry, bearing evidences
on the inside of adobe plastering. An exceptional feature is the
large number of the component stones decorated on their outer faces
with deeply incised geometrical figures, apparently traced with some
pointed implement.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Comparison of the architecture of this ruin with that of the Black
Falls ruin here figured (pl. <a href="#i017-1">3</a>) shows a resemblance which is more
than superficial, in the elevated site, character of the masonry, and
general ground plan; and comparison of its walls with those of Old
Walpi shows a similar likeness, which is instructive so far as it goes.
This is the only large ruin visited that is characterized by high standing
walls on top of an eminence, but Navaho guides said they were
familiar with others in this neighborhood similar in structure and
situation.</p>

<p>Immediately after leaving this ruin the attention is drawn to the
first of the large cliff-dwellings, cliff-house B, situated near Marsh
pass. The contrast in color of the Cretaceous rocks on the right
and the Triassic formations on the left side of the pass is noticeable
for some distance. The great cliff-dwellings are found high up in
the red sandstone on the left.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cliff-House B</span></h3>

<p>This picturesque ruin occupies the whole floor of a narrow, low
cave situated in an almost vertical cliff forming one side of a canyon
which extends deep into the mountain; the entrance is between
low hills on the left, where the road ascends to Marsh pass. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>ruin can be seen for a long distance, but as one approaches the canyon
in which it lies the site is hidden by foothills. The accompanying
view (pl. <a href="#i026">5</a>) was taken from the opposite side of the
canyon, it being impossible to get an extended detailed view of the
ruin from above or below. Beyond the ruin the canyon forms a narrowing
fissure with precipitous sides; its bed is covered with bushes,
stunted trees, and fallen rocks. No flowing water was found in this
canyon, but in the ledges near its mouth, below the ruins, there are
pockets and potholes which contained considerable water at the
time of the writer’s visit.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>This cliff-dwelling is difficult to enter, the walls of the canyon,
both above and below and on the sides, being almost perpendicular.
A pathway extending along the side of the cliff on the level of the
cave approaches within 20 feet of the ruin; from its end to the first
room of the ruin this trail is continued by a series of footholes pecked
in the rock, making entrance hazardous at this point.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Although
the walls of this cliff-dwelling are more or less destroyed and their
foundations deeply buried, there still remains standing masonry of a
square tower (?) reaching from the floor to the roof of the cave.
One corner of this tower is completely broken out, but the remaining
sides show that this building was three stories high, composed of
rooms one above another.</p>

<p>Several other rooms lie concealed under fallen walls and débris.
One of the most instructive of these is what may have been a <em>kiva</em>,
or ceremonial room,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> the location of its walls being indicated by
stakes projecting out of the ground. Lower down, where the wall
was better preserved, sticks or wickerwork were found interwoven in
the uprights, the whole being plastered with adobe, a form of wall
construction common in prehistoric ruins of Arizona.</p>

<p>In comparison with the Mesa Verde ruins, the masonry of this
ruin is poor, but the stones used in constructing the walls are large.
The many fragments of pottery strewn over the surface of the floor
of the cave resemble in symbolism pottery from Black Falls, the
same colors, black and white, predominating.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>In descending the declivity of the cliff in the sides of which cliff-house
B is situated, there comes to view a cluster of broken walls
crowning a low elevation, which indicate a former house of some size.
In their neighborhood are the foundations of other walls, and the
ground in the vicinity is strewn with many fragments of pottery and
much fallen masonry half buried in débris. Farther down the hill,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
on the level of the road and extending parallel with it, are low ridges
or mounds covered with pottery, indicating the former presence of a
pueblo of considerable size. No walls were traced in these mounds,
which seem to indicate the existence of an ancient cemetery, as
several rings of small stones, suggesting graves, were found. A short
distance beyond this supposed cemetery is a little cave, situated
a few hundred feet to the left of the road. In this cave are a few
walls, but the cliff-dwelling is not of great size; beyond it the road
rises steeply to Marsh pass. (Pl. <a href="#i030">6</a>.)</p>

<p>Although some of the ruins in the Navaho Monument may be visited
without the use of saddle horses, the largest can not now be approached
with wagons. It would be possible at a small expense, however,
so to improve the Indian trail up the canyon of Laguna creek that one
could drive within a fraction of a mile of the great ruins, Betatakin
and Kitsiel. At present, to reach these one must leave carriages at
Marsh pass and descend with saddle horses to the bed of Laguna
creek, which flows along the canyon, in the side branches of which are
situated the greatest two cliff-dwellings of the region. One of these,
Betatakin, is about six miles, the other, Kitsiel, about 10 miles, from
Marsh pass.</p>


<h3 id="nest"><span class="smcap">Swallows Nest</span></h3>

<p>Descending to Laguna creek and following the bottom of the
canyon, crossing and recrossing the stream several times, the first
cliff-dwelling is seen built in a niche in the cliffs high up on the right.
This ruin seems to fill the bottom of a symmetrically vaulted,
open cave, the high arched roof and sides of which are so eroded
that from one point of view the shadow cast by the ruin at certain
times outlines the profile of a head and part of a human body, as
seen in plate <a href="#i033">7</a>. Although a talus<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> extends from this ruin some distance
down the cliff, rendering access difficult, the ruin was entered,
but found to be in a poor state of preservation. Several of the walls,
viewed from the road, appeared to be in good condition, and some of
the rooms are more than one story high.</p>


<h3 id="betatakin"><span class="smcap">Betatakin</span></h3>

<p>Following the canyon about five miles from Marsh pass, the writer’s
party came to a fork in the canyon,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> where a guide was found who
led the way across the stream into a small side canyon, in the end of
which lies Betatakin. This canyon is wooded and at the time of
the writer’s visit contained plenty of water, a small stream
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>issuing from almost under the walls and trickling down through the
bushes over a mass of fallen rock which forms the talus. The climb
to the ruin from the place where horses must be abandoned is not
a hard one and a trail could easily be made; in fact a carriage
road might be constructed at small expense from Marsh pass to
within half a mile of this great ruin, one of the largest two and
best preserved cliff-dwellings in the Navaho National Monument.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">BETATAKIN—GENERAL VIEW</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>A feature of this ruin (plates 8-11) which attracts attention on
entering it is the fine echo, due to the shape of the open cave in which
it lies. Were the name not preempted, it would seem that Echo
House would be a much more appropriate designation for the ruin
than Betatakin, “High-ledges House,” applied to it by the Navaho.</p>

<p>Certain differences in architectural features between cliff-houses in
the Mesa Verde region and those here considered are apparent. The
caves in which the cliff-dwellings of the Navaho Monument region are
situated differ in geological formation from those of the Mesa Verde
National Park. While in the former there are many instances of
horizontal cleavage planes, as a rule the falling of blocks of stone has
left vertical flat faces. On this account the caves are shallow and
high-vaulted rather than extending deep into the cliff. The process
of formation of these vertical planes of cleavage is shown by examining
plate <a href="#i041">9</a>; in this case a pinnacle of rock has begun to break away and is
partially separated from the surface of the cliff. This pinnacle will
ultimately topple over and fall as many have done before, leaving a
broken stump at its former base. In this way, from time to time, in
the past geological history of the cave, detached pinnacles and slabs
of rock have broken away along these vertical planes of cleavage,
leaving the tops of their broken bases later to become foundations
for rooms. Similar flat vertical planes of cleavage are rare, almost
unknown, in the Mesa Verde caves. Here the cleavage is horizontal,
the caves extending deep into the cliffs.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The modifications in architecture brought about by the difference
in direction of these cleavage planes are apparent. The ancient
builders in the Navaho Monument region utilized the vertical faces
as supports for walls of rooms on one or more sides. In some cases
the face of the cliff forms the rear walls; in others a side wall and the
rear wall of a room are formed by vertical cleavage planes at right
angles, as shown in plate <a href="#i041">9</a>. It can be seen that adjacent houses built
upon fallen rocks of different heights, the vertical faces being utilized
as rear walls, would seem to stand one above another, or, in other
words, they would present the well-known terrace form which exists
in some modern pueblos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>The writer approached this ruin by following the fallen débris at
the end, where the rooms, being without covering and exposed to
the elements, are most dilapidated. Over this fallen mass one makes
his way with difficulty and is often in danger of falling from the cliff.
On account of the perpendicular face of the cliff below the foundations
of the other end of the ruin, it is impossible to climb into it,
except from this side. On approaching the ruin there is to be seen
on the vertical face of the cliff a pictograph (pl. <a href="#i053">12</a>) worthy of
special mention, or rather two pictographs which are doubtless connected
in meaning. The larger of these is a circle, painted white,
resembling a shield (a common object in pictographic representation),
the other a horned animal, perhaps a mountain sheep.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The figure
on the shield, which bears evidence of former coloration, represents
a human being with outstretched arms, the hands being raised to the
level of the head. On each side of the body are represented two
designs—a circle of yellow and a crescent in which are parallel bands
of red, yellow, and probably green.</p>

<p>The rooms in this cliff-house are rectangular, cubical, or box-like
structures built against the face of the cliff, which serves as their
rear wall. There are no towers or round rooms such as those that
lend picturesqueness to several of the Mesa Verde cliff-dwellings. Few
of the rooms are more than two stories high, the appearance of
terraced rooms being given by the varying heights of their foundations.
The masonry is crude, the lines are irregular, and the
external faces of the walls vertical. The interior wall was probably
plastered, and some walls afford good evidence that their exterior
was formerly covered with mud.</p>

<p>A marked feature of ruins in this region is the adobe walls supported
by rows of stakes with interwoven sticks. No adobe bricks
were seen in the walls examined.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>One of the largest clusters of rooms in this cliff-house (Betatakin)
stands on a huge rock foundation, the vertical face of which is
continuous with the wall of masonry of the front building of the
cluster. (Pl. <a href="#i050">11</a>.) The rear wall of the front room is formed by the
vertical face of the cliff. About half of the roof of this room has gone,
but several patches still remain even in the broken section. The rooms
of the higher tier are set against an upright wall. The doorway is on
one side. The shelf of rock on which this room stands is level with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>the roof of the first room and the cave wall forms its rear. This
room was probably a ceremonial chamber, having a fire-hole in the
floor, between which and the doorway is a low wall of masonry corresponding
to the deflector, or altar, in Mesa Verde ruins.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The
part of the floor on which one steps in entering this room is raised
slightly above the remainder, serving to connect the base of the
deflector with the doorsill. The deflector and fire-hole are practically
duplicates of features common to several Cliff Palace kivas.
At Betatakin, however, the ceremonial room is above ground, not
subterranean, and is entered from the side instead of from the top.</p>

<p>A two-story room stands on the rock one tier higher than the ceremonial
room just mentioned, its foundation being at the level of the
roof of the ceremonial room, as shown in the illustration. The front
wall of this room is more or less broken down, but on one side, where
projecting rafters are found in place, the masonry, otherwise unbroken,
is pierced by a small window. This room has also a door on the side.
Several well-preserved rooms extend along a ledge of rock on the
same level as the roofs of these buildings, forming another tier above
the ceremonial room. One of these has a fine roof; ends of rafters
extend from the walls.</p>

<p>Beyond the ceremonial room, on the side where the ruin is most
dilapidated, may be noted the same arrangement of the rooms in tiers
or terraces, brought about by the varying height of their foundations.
Several walls in these rooms are in good condition, but the fronts of
many are broken down. Here are found rows of sticks or supports
projecting from the débris. The walls are almost invariably of stone;
those supported by sticks are usually connecting walls. The roofs of
some of these rooms are entire, but many are broken, although their
rafters still remain in place.</p>

<p>The whole length of Betatakin is not far from 600 feet, following
the foundations from one end to the other. There are not far from
100 rooms visible, and evidences of others covered with débris. The
larger of the two rooms identified as ceremonial rooms on account
of their deflectors, measures 10 by 7 feet and is about 5 feet high;
the smaller is about 7 feet square. There are no vertical ventilators
as in circular kivas, the smoke evidently finding egress through a
small hole in the roof. The floor of one of these ceremonial rooms
was cut in the solid rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>As above mentioned, there are no circular rooms or towers in
Betatakin, although one room has a rounded corner. Traces of the
repair of doors and windows are evident, but none of these apertures
are T-shaped.</p>

<p>One of the interesting features in Betatakin and several other ruins
in this region consists in rows of eyelets cut in the rocky side of the
cliff evidently for the attachment of some long object.</p>

<p>A cluster of small rooms isolated from those above described are
shown in plate <a href="#i041">9</a>; these give a good idea of the general type of architecture
of these buildings and of the modifications or adaptations due
to the sites on which they are erected and the vertical cliffs against
which they are built. Three rooms set into the angle formed by
two vertical cliff faces at right angles to each other illustrate how the
cliff serves for rear walls and how the buildings are attached to it
for support. The roofs of these rooms are entire and their rafters
project beyond the upright walls. The doors and windows are,
comparatively speaking, small and rectangular in form. Fragments
of walls projecting out of the ground indicate the existence of many
rooms covered with débris. These are especially numerous at the
end of the ruin to which the trail leads, but as most of them are
buried an adequate idea of their arrangement can not be gained without
systematic excavation.</p>


<h3 id="keet"><span class="smcap">Kitsiel (Keet Seel)</span></h3>

<p>This ruin, which lies about 10 miles from Marsh pass, is a most
interesting cliff-dwelling.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> As this is the best preserved of all the
ruins thus far discovered in the Navaho National Monument, it
should be excavated and repaired for future visitors and students.
Kitsiel is a large ruin, its length (estimated at 300 feet) being not
less than that of the greatest cliff-dwelling of the Mesa Verde National
Park. Like other ruins in the vicinity, it is not so picturesque as the
structures of that region, lacking round towers and other features so
attractive in Cliff Palace.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The accompanying illustration (pl. <a href="#i058">13</a>)
presents the ground plan of this ruin, the architectural features of
which are similar to those of Betatakin.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">BETATAKIN—CENTRAL PART</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>One of the most striking features of Kitsiel is the great log, 35 feet
long, under which the visitor passes to inspect the interior of the ruin.
West of this log, which evidently once supported a retaining wall, the
rooms are well preserved; east of it this wall in places has slipped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>down the cliff and its component stones are to be found in the talus
below.</p>

<p>It is difficult to discover how many rooms this great cliff-house
formerly had, but there is little doubt that they numbered more than
150, besides the kivas. This ruin is believed to be one of the largest
known cliff-dwellings of the Southwest, ranking in size the Cliff
Palace in the Mesa Verde, which it does not rival, however, in variety
of architectural features. The masonry in Kitsiel is inferior to that
in the Spruce-tree House and the Balcony House, the walls of which
show the highest aboriginal achievement in stonework north of
Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>The walled inclosures of Kitsiel are reducible to a few types of
which the following may be distinguished:</p>

<p>(1) Kivas, or circular subterranean rooms with a large banquette
on one side, the walls being generally broken down and without
pilasters or roof-supports.</p>

<p>(2) Kihus, or rectangular rooms with doors on one side, each having
a low bank, or “deflector,” rising from the floor between the
doorway and the fire-hole. Instead of this bank being free from the
wall, as at Betatakin, it is generally joined to it on one side, the floor
at the point of junction being raised slightly above the remaining
level. Smoke-holes are sometimes, but not always, present in the
roof. These rooms, like the circular rooms, are ceremonial in character.
The only opening in their floors that can be compared with
the ceremonial aperture, or <em>sipapû</em>, is a shallow depression a few
inches deep. The diameters of these openings are greater than in
the case of the sipapû in Cliff Palace kivas.</p>

<p>(3) Rectangular rooms, some of which have benches and show
evidence of having been living rooms.</p>

<p>(4) Large rooms each with a fireplace in the middle of the floor.</p>

<p>(5) Rooms with metates set in bins made of stone slabs (milling
rooms).</p>

<p>(6) Courts and streets. The longest street extends from the middle
of the ruin to the western end and is lined on both sides by rooms
many of the roofs of which are still intact.</p>

<p>An instructive architectural feature of some of the rooms of this
ruin is the use of upright logs in supporting corners. Part of the roof
of one of these rooms situated deep in the cave is formed by the natural
rock and the remainder by an artificial covering supported by
upright logs forked at the end to receive the rafters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>


<h3 id="scaffold"><span class="smcap">Scaffold House</span></h3>

<p>This ruin, about 2 miles from the place where two large canyons
open into Laguna creek, lies in a cavern worn in the side of a large
butte on the left of the stream. It is appropriately called Scaffold
House from a finely made wooden scaffold (fig. 1) which the ancients
constructed in a vertical cleft in the cliff about 50 feet above the
east end of the ruin. Although this scaffold is now inaccessible from
the walls of the room below,
all the beams and much
of the earthen floor still
remain.</p>

Scaffold of Scaffold House.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The construction of the
scaffold is as follows: The
crevice in which it lies is
rectangular, with the longest
axis vertical. Several
large logs placed horizontally,
their ends fitted into
holes pecked in the sides of
the crevice, support smaller
beams laid across them at
right angles. These latter
in turn are covered with
small sticks on which are
laid bark and clay, leaving
a hatchway at a point about
midway. The construction
of this scaffold, probably
as daring a piece of aerial
building as can be found
anywhere among cliff-dwellings,
is so well preserved
that it shows no sign of
deterioration. We can only
conjecture what its use may
have been, but the plausible suggestion has been made that it was
an outlook or place of defense.</p>

<p>Scaffold House is about 300 feet long. The rooms, which are in
fine condition, extend along the side of the cliff, those situated
midway of the length of the ruin being fairly well preserved. There
are not far from 56 rooms still to be traced, and at least two circular
kivas, the walls of one of which are still in fair condition. The larger
kiva measures about 15 feet in diameter; it is subterranean, with a
deep bench or banquette on one side. There is no trace of the pilasters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>so conspicuous in the circular kivas of the Mesa Verde. The inner
walls are smoothly plastered.</p>

<p>Enough of the roof of this kiva remains to show the method of
construction, and as this is the first example of such a roof the writer
has ever examined a brief description of it may prove to be instructive.
(See pl. <a href="#i062-1">14</a>.) The supports or rafters are three in number,
consisting of a large middle log laid across the center of the kiva
halfway between the banquette and the opposite side, and of two
smaller logs, parallel with it, resting on the top of the kiva wall, one
across the banquette, and the other at about an equal distance on
the opposite side. A number of smaller transverse beams, parallel
with one another, are supported by the three logs already mentioned,
and upon these lie the layers of sticks, bark, and adobe which cover
the roof. No hatchway or place for a vertical opening was to be
seen, but as the covering of the banquette is missing it is quite
possible that the entrance to the kiva may have had some connection
with this feature.</p>

<br>

<p>The top of a vertical stone slab, comparable in shape and position
with a deflector, was seen projecting out of the débris that fills the
lower part of the kiva, and rods in the wall near the roof represent
pegs found at the tops of the pilasters in Mesa Verde kivas. There
is a niche at one side for small objects, a constant feature in all kivas,
circular and rectangular. The fire-hole was covered with débris.</p>

<p>The second circular kiva, which belongs to the same subtype, is
situated not far from the one described, but is much more dilapidated,
about half its walls having fallen. The roof of this kiva
appears to have been supported in part by upright logs isolated from
the walls, inside the chamber, three of which still stand in their
original positions. This feature reminds one of kivas of the Rio
Grande region as described by Castañeda, the historian of the Coronado
expedition in 1540-42. In addition to the two circular kivas
Scaffold House contains another room that may have been ceremonial
in character, having all the essentials of the Betatakin rooms herein
referred to as kivas. It lies near the western end of the ruin, its
northwestern wall being bound by the vertical cliff. This room is
rectangular, with a lateral entrance opposite which is a low
bank, or deflector; the floor between the latter and the doorway is
raised slightly above the general level. The fire-hole occupies a position
on the other side, as in rooms of this kind in Betatakin. It was
noticed that the sides of the doorway are considerably worn and that
its lintel is made of split sticks.</p>

<p>In addition to the two circular subterranean kivas at Scaffold House
there is at least one kihu in this ruin. This is situated near the western
end, being built against the upright or rear wall of the cavern to
which the two side walls are joined. The doorway is like those of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
kihus in Betatakin and is situated opposite the cliff-wall. The roof
has fallen in, but the beams and wattling remain in place as they fell.
There is a fire-hole in the middle of the floor, and between it and the
doorway is a deflector made of upright staves between which is adobe
work; the whole is plastered with adobe. The threshold of the low
doorway is slightly elevated above the floor, and between it and the
base of the deflector is a raised platform. The lintels are made of
sticks split with wedges, possibly of stone, as shown by their fibrous
surfaces.</p>

<p>There are many pictographs on the cliff at Scaffold House, the
most conspicuous of which represent human hands, snakes (one of
them is 15 feet long), mountain sheep or other horned mammals, and
nondescript figures representing tailed human beings.</p>

<p>The ruins at Bubbling Spring, a short distance from Scaffold House,
are inconspicuous.</p>


<h3 id="cradle"><span class="smcap">Cradle House</span></h3>

<p>This large ruin,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> so named from the finding of the cradle described
and illustrated herein, is situated in the side of a bluff rising above
East canyon. It contains about 50 rooms and at least 3 circular
kivas without pilasters, the front walls of which are considerably
broken down.</p>

<p>The rooms of Cradle House as a rule extend along the rear of the
cave, their back walls generally being formed by the vertical wall of
the cliff, there being no recess behind them. The majority of the
rooms lie about midway in the length of the ruin, the kivas being situated
in front of the cluster. In two or three places rooms are found
on levels below or above that of the main cluster, but only rarely are
there rooms in front of others on the same level. On the upper ledge
near the western end a small bin is found at the base of which is a
considerable depression, probably artificial.</p>


<h3 id="ladder"><span class="smcap">Ladder House</span></h3>

<p>The more or less dilapidated walls of this ruin are to be seen from
the left bank of East canyon, a few miles farther upstream. The position
is indicated by an enormous butte which projects into the canyon
and diverts the stream at that point. One side of this butte is eroded
in such a way as to resemble in outline an elephant’s trunk, this erosion
marking the initial process in the formation of a “natural bridge.”
On the opposite side of this butte there is another large cliff-dwelling,
which was not visited.</p>

<h3 id="forest"><span class="smcap">Forest-glen House</span></h3>

<p>The fine growth of trees at the base of a large cliff-house about 2
miles beyond Cradle House has suggested the name Forest-glen
House. Some of the walls are in the form of concentric semicircles
with the conspicuous representation of a head attached to one side.
Many rocks have fallen on this ruin from the cave roof, especially
at one end, but the rooms at the western end are still well preserved.</p>


<h3 id="pine"><span class="smcap">Pine-tree House</span></h3>

<p>About 8 miles up East canyon there is a large, almost inaccessible,
ruin, which lies a short distance from the main canyon. A striking
feature of this ruin is its division into three parts, of which the central
section is somewhat lower than the one on each side. A large pine
on the edge of the cliff above has suggested the name Pine-tree House.
Deep below this ruin is a large basin, in which grow many trees and
bushes; among these are a good spring and a small rivulet. This
ruin has two very large circular kivas, without pedestals, 20 to 30
feet in diameter. A deep banquette is present on one side. This ruin
exhibits no evidence of having been dug.</p>


<h3 id="spring"><span class="smcap">Trickling-spring House</span></h3>

<p>After descending to Laguna creek from Marsh pass, crossing the
stream, and following the bank about 2 miles, one comes to a ridge of
copper-bearing rocks, beyond which the road crosses a deep ravine.
On following the right bank this ravine is found to extend into
the cliffs as a canyon. A few miles after entering the canyon a
stream is encountered emerging from a spring and trickling
over a cliff. High above this cliff, in a canyon 60 or 80 feet
in size, the entrance to which is surrounded and more or less concealed
by stately pines, spruces, and cedars, stands a cliff-ruin,
possibly never before visited by white men, for which the
name Trickling-spring House is suggested. Although this ruin is
small, it is in several respects unique. The main architectural
feature is a diminutive court or plaza, into which open a number
of small rooms, having well-plastered walls and low entrances.
In this, as in most of the other ruins in the Navaho National
Monument, some of the house-walls are constructed of stone; but
many are made of clay, plastered on sticks or wickerwork supported
by upright logs. The masonry when present is poor as a rule, the
component stones rarely being dressed into shape, but the surface
plastering, especially on the kiva walls, is good. Many walls stand on
rocks that have evidently fallen from the roof of the cave. A metate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
set in position in one of the smaller rooms indicates that this particular
inclosure served as a milling room.</p>

<p>Two squarish rooms, with lateral doorways and a deflector or wall
before them, are identified as kihus. One of these has a platform or
floor connecting the
base of the ventilator
and the doorway.
The deflector
is free from the kihu
walls at both ends.
The walls of a
room with a deflector
which opens into
the plaza are very
much blackened
with smoke. No
circular subterranean
room was observed.

several well-preserved
hatchways

common in addition
to lateral entrances
with well-preserved
sills and
lintels. One or two
of the small windows

walls have a downward
slant, as if to
afford a better view of visitors approaching from below. One of
these old doorways was closed with masonry, constructed possibly
when the room was deserted. There are no signs of vandalism in
this ruin.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>


<h3 id="ruins"><span class="smcap">Characteristic Features of Ruins</span></h3>

<p>The existence of recesses and of refuse heaps back of the buildings
in caves is characteristic of Mesa Verde cliff-dwellings. In the cliff-houses
of the Canyon de Chelly and Marsh Pass regions they rarely
exist, the house walls being built against the rear wall of the cave,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>leaving very little space behind them for refuse or fallen débris. This
latter feature, due to the geological character of the caves, is also
prominent in the cliff-dwellings of the Red Rock country, at the headwaters
of the Verde and its tributaries, and is likewise found in a few
cliff-houses of the Gila visited by the writer. From one point of view
the use of the wall or walls of the cave as house-walls marks a typical
form of cliff-dwelling, or a dependent village, distinguished from a
cliff-dwelling like Cliff Palace, the walls of which are independent or
free on all sides from the cliffs.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p class="center no-indent">DIAGRAM SHOWING KIVA ROOF CONSTRUCTION</p>
<br>

<p>The masonry of the Navaho Monument ruins is crude as compared
with that found in the ruins of the Mesa Verde National Park, and
walls made of adobe supported by upright sticks are more numerous.
The character of the masonry may be due in part to the slab-like character
of the building stones, and possibly to their greater hardness.
The relative predominance of adobe walls supported by upright
sticks was fostered by the ease with which they could be constructed
and the quantity of clay available for building purposes. Comparison
of the masonry of ruins in the Navaho Monument with that of the
Black Falls region shows a resemblance much greater than that existing
between either group and the cliff-houses of the Mesa Verde
region.</p>

<p>There is no architectural feature in Southwestern ruins more distinctive
than the ceremonial rooms, or kivas, but as these have never
been recognized throughout a large area of Arizona, it is important
to determine the character of the ceremonial rooms of the Navaho
Monument ruins and to compare them with kivas at present used by
the Hopi.</p>

<p>While as a rule there is great similarity in secular rooms in different
culture areas of the Southwest, the more archaic ceremonial rooms of
these regions vary considerably. The rooms ordinarily called kivas
are of two distinct types, circular and rectangular. There are two
kinds of circular kivas,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> one having pilasters and banquettes to support
the roof, the other without pilasters, apparently roofless, but
surrounded by high walls as if for the purpose of obscuring the view
from neighboring plazas. The circular kivas commonly do not form a
part of the house mass, being separated some distance from the secular
rooms. From all that can be learned it appears that the round kiva
is an ancient type, its position in the rear of the cave in such cliff-dwellings
as Spruce-tree House and Cliff Palace indicating that this
form is as old as the building itself. The circular type, with pilasters,
is confined wholly to the eastern region, having been reported from
the Mesa Verde, the San Juan and many of its tributaries, Chaco<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
canyon, and certain ruins west of the Rio Grande. Circular kivas
somewhat modified are found also in many of the Rio Grande pueblos,
where they are still in use. A subtype of circular kivas without
pilasters but provided each with one large banquette is the common
form of circular ceremonial room in the Navaho National Monument
and the Canyon de Chelly. The modern representative of this subtype
is the Snake kiva of the Hopi, which has become rectangular,
the large banquette (<em>tuwibi</em>, pl. <a href="#i062-1">14</a>) being modified into the “spectators,”
or elevated surface of the floor.</p>

<p>The corresponding ceremonial rooms at Zuñi and in the prehistoric
Hopi pueblos are rectangular in form and of simpler architecture.
Similarly shaped ceremonial rooms, not subterranean, are still
in use in modern Hopi pueblos. As a good example of this
archaic form of ceremonial room at Walpi may be mentioned that
in which the Flute altar is erected and in which the Flute secret
rites are performed.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> This ancestral room of the clan is a rectangular
chamber forming part of the second floor, and is entered from one
side. The Flute clans came from a pueblo, now a ruin, in the north,
but after union with the Ala, who lived at Tokónabi, they settled at
the Snake pueblo, Walpi. So it may be supposed that their ancestors
also had no special kiva, but celebrated their secret rites in an
ordinary house.</p>

<p>The fraternity of Sun priests likewise erect their altar and perform
their secret ceremonies in a room, not in a kiva; so do the Kalektaka,
or warriors. None of these rooms is commonly regarded or enumerated
as a kiva, but such chambers are believed to be the direct representatives
of the ceremonial rooms built above ground as a part of
the house, in the manner more characteristic of ceremonial rooms in
Arizona ruins.</p>

<p>The ruins in the Navaho Monument have ceremonial rooms allied
on one side to the kivas of the San Juan region, and on the other to
rooms in the Little Colorado ruins that may have been built for
ceremonial use. The latter are constructed above ground, inclosed
by other houses, and are rectangular in shape, with lateral doorways.
Some of these rooms, as at Betatakin, contain each a fire screen and a
fire-hole, as in a circular kiva, the ventilator being replaced by a lateral
doorway. It is possible that when the Snake people inhabited their
northern homes, before they came to Walpi, their ceremonial rooms
were not built, as at present, partly underground, and placed at a
distance from the secular houses. The ceremonial rooms of this clan
and of immediate relatives when living at Tokónabi or in the Navaho
Monument region may have resembled those of the Black Falls
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>cluster of ruins.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Their subterranean position and separation from
other rooms may be regarded as modifications due to foreign influences
after the clan arrived at Walpi.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p class="center no-indent">POTTERY FROM NAVAHO NATIONAL MONUMENT</p>
<br>

<p>The sunken or subterranean situation of the ceremonial assembly
room, or kiva, of the Pueblo region is an architectural survival of a
people whose secular and ceremonial rooms were subterranean. This
feature may not be autochthonous in this area, or limited to it geographically,
having probably been derived from people of kindred
culture of the West coast, as pointed out by Mr. Ernest Sarfert’s argument
on this point, which would seem to be conclusive if subterranean
kivas could be found in the Gila and Little Colorado regions.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The forms of pueblo kivas, circular or rectangular, are not derived
one from the other, but suggest different geographical origins. The
circular form, confined to the eastern Pueblo area, bears evidence of
having been derived from the culture of a people inhabiting a
forested region; while the rectangular form strongly suggests a
people with a treeless habitat. Both circular and rectangular subterranean
assembly rooms existed in aboriginal California in historic
and prehistoric times. The archaic or prehistoric culture of the
Pueblo region is closely related to that of the West coast in other particulars
also, that do not concern the subject of this article.</p>

<p>When the Snake clans lived at Tokónabi, and later at Wukóki (on
the Little Colorado), so far as known they had no subterranean rooms
isolated from the others for ceremonial purposes, but used rooms so
closely resembling other apartments that they may be called “living
rooms.” Even when they came to the Hopi mesas they may not have
had at first a specialized ceremonial chamber. A study of Arizona
ruins reveals no rooms identified as ceremonial that are isolated from
the house masses. This is true of cliff-dwellings and pueblos, and it
is probable that the differentiation and separation of kivas from
secular houses, found in modern Hopi pueblos, are an introduced
feature of comparatively late date. At Zuñi a rectangular room, not
separated from the house mass, serves as a kiva, the custom in this
respect approaching more closely that found among their kindred,
the ancient people of the Little Colorado river, than among the more
modified Hopi of the present time.</p>

<p>While some of the rooms identified as ceremonial in preceding pages
are rectangular in shape and not isolated from secular rooms, the
circular type seems also to have been found in Utah, and at Kitsiel
and ruins near it. South of Marsh pass circular kivas are less abundant,
and it appears that somewhere in this region is a line of demarcation
between ruins with circular kivas and those with rectangular kivas.
In prehistoric ruins from Marsh pass southward<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> to the Gila valley no
rooms have ever been identified as kivas, although in the cavate ruins
called Old Caves, near Flagstaff, are subterranean rooms entered from
the floor of a room above, which may have served for the performance
of religious rites.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>From a comparison of some features of the kivas in the cliff-dwellings
of the San Juan and its tributaries with those of the Navaho Monument
it would appear that while the ceremonial rooms of the latter in certain
details are like those of the former, in some cases their form and
position are different. So far as this resemblance goes, it may be
reasoned that the San Juan ancients influenced by their culture the
northern Arizona cliff-dwellers, but there is scant evidence of the
reverse, that is, that the San Juan pueblos borrowed from the culture
of the northern Arizonians any architectural features, especially
in the form and construction of their kivas. The theory would be
logical that the prehistoric migration of culture was down rather
than up the river, and the symbolism of the pottery contributes
interesting data supporting this conclusion.</p>

Inscription House, Scaffold House, and others, they were not seen in Betatakin, which has the rectangular
ceremonial room with side entrance above mentioned. Although such rooms possess some of the features
of kivas, it is perhaps better to restrict that term to the circular chambers and adopt the word kihu to
designate the rectangular rooms above ground. The ceremonial chambers of Betatakin suggest the Flute
room at Walpi. This fact and the discovery of a flute in one of the rooms make it appear that Betatakin
was inhabited by Flute clans, which, according to Hopi legends, lived in this region.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the limited duration of the writer’s visit to the
Navaho National Monument, a few specimens of stone, wood,
pottery, and other objects were collected. The whole pieces of pottery,
numbering 14 specimens (pls. 15-18), the majority of which
came probably from Inscription House and other ruins near Red
Lake, were presented to the Smithsonian Institution by Mr. Stephen
Janus, Navaho agent at Tuba, who accompanied the writer on the
trip to the Marsh Pass ruins. Fragments of pottery were picked up
on the surface at Betatakin, Kitsiel, and several other ruins, and
the most characteristic of these were brought back to Washington.
No excavations were attempted, nor could all objects that were seen
be brought away. Although up to within a few years these ruins
were practically in the condition they were when abandoned, unfortunately
of late they have been despoiled and many beautiful
specimens have been taken from them. Many objects still remain
which should be removed lest they fall into improper hands.</p>

<h3 id="pottery"><span class="smcap">Pottery</span></h3>

<p>The pottery collected consists of jars, vases, food bowls, and circular
disks with a row of perforations about the margin. There are also
dipper handles and broken ladles of the usual shape. Some of these
specimens are of corrugated ware, others have smooth surfaces with
painted decoration. The proportion of corrugated and indented ware
found in the Navaho Monument ruins is about the same as in the
Mesa Verde National Park. The finest coiled ware was obtained
from the latter locality. Several fragments of flat dishes, perforated
on their margins (pl. <a href="#i065-1">15</a>, <em>b</em>), or colanders having holes in the middle,
form part of the collection.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The most instructive form of pottery in the collection brought
back from northern Arizona is a decorated globular vase of black-and-white
ware (pl. <a href="#i069-1">16</a>, <em>b</em>). The decoration on this specimen is not
confined to the exterior but is found also on the inner surface of the
lip; it consists mainly of triangles so united as to form hour-glass
figures. A unique design on this vessel consists of two parallel lines,
each with dots on one side, suggesting similar bands in red on the
inner wall of the third story of the square tower of Cliff Palace.</p>

<p>Three small bowls of crude ware are fluted on the outside, the ridge,
or fluting, being raised somewhat above the surface of the bowl and
having a zigzag course. One of the best of these unique ceramic
forms has this fluting broken into S-shaped figures, as shown in the
accompanying illustration (pl. <a href="#i073-1">17</a>, <em>a</em>).</p>

<p>The writer collected also several perforated clay disks which were
possibly used as spindle whorls, although they may have been
gaming implements. A similar disk made of mountain-sheep horn
was found at Kitsiel.</p>

<p>The largest and one of the finest vases (pl. <a href="#i077-1">18</a>, <em>a</em>) from the neighborhood
of Red Lake is also of black-and-white ware. The decoration
is external and consists of black figures covering the neck
and upper body. The base is rounded and the lip slightly flaring.
This vase may have been used for containing water or possibly as a
receptacle for prayer (corn) meal. The food bowls from Red Lake
are chiefly of black-and-white ware, the red and yellow varieties
being less numerous. A common feature in food bowls of this
region is a handle on one side, as shown in plate <a href="#i065-1">15</a>, <em>d</em>. Some of
these vessels, although of smooth ware, are without decoration on
either the exterior or the interior.</p>

<p>The shallow, slightly concave clay disk<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> shown in plate <a href="#i065-1">15</a>, <em>b</em>, is
characteristic in possessing a row of holes near the rim. This disk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
seems to represent a common type, as several fragments with similar
holes were found on the surface of the ruins. The same or related
forms appear to have been common in ruins near the Hopi pueblos.
These are found in the collection of votive offerings now in the
Peabody Museum at Cambridge, from Jedito spring, near Awatobi,
and the writer has discovered specimens elsewhere in Hopi ruins, a
brief mention of which occurs in a report on the archeological results
of his expedition to Arizona in 1895.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Several fragments of deep bowls, each having a handle (pl. <a href="#i077-1">18</a>, <em>b</em>)
on the surface, were obtained in the sands below cliff-house B;
these are commonly of red ware and have reddish-brown and
black decorations. A small dish of black-and-white ware (pl. <a href="#i065-1">15</a>, <em>a</em>)
has the rim slightly elevated and rounded on one side. The cups or
mugs from this region are shaped unlike those from the Mesa Verde.
Mugs from the latter region are cylindrical in form or the walls incline
slightly inward so that the diameter of the opening is somewhat
less than that of the base. The lip is thick and decorated. One of
these cups, here figured, has a constricted neck, and a slightly flaring
rim which is thin and undecorated. The decoration of another cup
(pl. <a href="#i065-1">15</a>, <i>c</i>) suggests the designs on several mugs from the Little
Colorado ruins. So far as form and decoration are concerned, this
cup, or handled vase, might have come from Homolobi, Chevlon, or
Chaves pass.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The designs on fragments of pottery found in ruins in northern
Arizona are identical with or related to those from the Black Falls
ruins, but differ somewhat from those on pottery from ruins higher
up the Little Colorado river. If the history of the modification of
ceramic symbols in any of the large composite pueblos of the Southwest
be studied, it will be noticed that there are often radical changes,
the later symbols not being modifications of earlier ones. Thus
modern Zuñi pottery designs differ materially from those found in
ruins in the same valley. The modern pottery from East mesa is
wholly different from that of Sikyatki, a few miles away. Again, in
so-called modern Hopi pottery, Tewa symbols derived from the Rio
Grande have replaced old Hopi symbols dominant before the advent
of Tewa clans. The changes in pottery symbols in every large composite
pueblo are not due to evolution of the modern from the ancient,
but reflect the history of the advent of new clans, powerful enough
to substitute their designs for those formerly existing. One of the
problems of the ethnologist is to determine symbols associated with
certain clans, and by means of legends to identify clans with ruins.
Having determined the symbols introduced by certain clans and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>places where these clans halted in their migrations and built pueblos,
the course of these prehistoric movements may be followed. Comparison
of symbols on pottery from northern Arizona with those from
Black Falls ruins support, so far as they go, the legends that the
Snake people, who once lived at Wukóki near the Black Falls, lived
also in cliff-houses now ruins near Marsh pass or the White mesa.
The symbolism indicates the presence of the same clans, and tradition
is thereby supported.</p>


<h3 id="cliff"><span class="smcap">Cliff-dwellers Cradle</span></h3>

<p>One of the most instructive specimens collected in the Navaho
National Monument was found by Mr. W. B. Douglass in a ruin designated
as Cradle House. This object is a cradle made of basket ware,
open at one end and continued at the opposite end into a biped
extension to serve for the legs. It is decorated on the outside with an
archaic geometric ornamentation, the unit design of which is shown in
the accompanying illustration. This specimen (pls. 19-21) may be
regarded as one of the finest examples of prehistoric basketry from the
Southwest; moreover, with one exception, it is the only known cradle
of this form. A pair of infant’s sandals found with the cradle leaves
no doubt as to its use, while the character and symbolism of the
decoration refer it to the ancient cliff-house culture. The design
(fig. 3) suggests that which characterizes certain specimens of the
well-known black-and-white pottery found in the San Juan drainage.
Evidences of long use and repair appear, especially on one side.
Unfortunately, the specimen, although entire when found, later was
broken across its middle.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>The only other known cradle of this type was brought to the
attention of ethnologists by Dr. W. J. McGee when in charge of the
anthropological exhibit at the St. Louis Exposition. This was found
in San Juan county, Utah, not far from the Colorado river.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> This
specimen is better preserved than that here figured, but the decoration
is practically identical; so near, in fact, that the two might have been
made by the same woman.</p>


<h3 id="objects"><span class="smcap">Miscellaneous Objects</span></h3>

<p>The stone implements (pl. <a href="#i073-1">17</a>, <i>c</i>) consist of axes, pounding stones,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
and hatchets. On one of the roofs at Kitsiel there was picked up a
curved stick<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> identical with those placed by the Walpi Snake priests
about the sand-painting of their altar. A good specimen of a planting
stick and a rod formerly used as a spindle were found near by;
the latter is a perforated disk made of horn. A flute identical with
those used at the present day by Flute priests at Walpi was found
at Betatakin, thus tending to support the legend that the Flute clan
once lived at the latter pueblo.</p>

<p>The route chosen by the author for visiting the ruins of the Navaho
National Monument is via Flagstaff and Tuba, the distance being not
far from 200 miles to Marsh pass and 10 miles beyond to the largest
cliff-dwellings. Although the wagon road is long, requiring a journey
of at least five days, it may be traversed with carriage or buckboard,
the sandy stretch between Tuba and Red Lake being the most difficult.
The trail from Marsh pass to the great cliff-dwellings, although now
passable only on horseback, could be made into a wagon road at
small expense.</p>

<p>The nature of the cliffs in which the ruins of the Navaho Monument
are situated favored the construction of cliff-dwellings rather than of
open pueblos in this region. These cliffs are full of caverns, large
and small, presenting much the same condition as the cliffs of the red
sandstone elsewhere in the Southwest, as the Mesa Verde, Canyon de
Chelly, the Red Rocks south of Flagstaff, and other sections where
caverns abound. Fragments of fallen rocks present good plane surfaces
for walls of masonry, and there is abundant clay for plastering.
Trees suitable for rafters and beams are not wanting. In short, all
conditions are favorable for stone and adobe houses in the cliffs. The
neighboring Sethlagini mesa is of different geological formation; in it
are no caverns, the mesa top is broad, and ruins thereon are necessarily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>open pueblos. The effect of difference in geological structure is
nowhere more evident than in these adjacent formations.</p>

<p>If environment has had so marked an influence on the character
of building, we can readily see how it has affected arts and crafts.
We can hardly imagine a people living any length of time in this region
without being mentally influenced by the precipitous cliffs that
rise on all sides. The summits of these heights are eroded into fantastic
shapes resembling animals or grotesque human forms. The constant
presence of these marvelous forms, of awe-inspiring size and weird
appearance, exerted a profound influence on the supernatural ideas
of the inhabitants. Here were born many conceptions of earth gods
and the like, survivals of which still remain among the Hopi.</p>

<p>As a rule the cliff-houses are not situated in sight of the main
stream, but are hidden away in secluded side canyons, approached
by narrow entrances, their sites having been determined no doubt
by the position of the springs with their constant water supply.</p>

<p>Almost every side canyon, even in a dry season, has its spring of
water which, trickling out of the rocks, follows the canyon bed until
it is finally drunk up by the thirsty sands. Often water seeps out of a
soft stratum of rock in the cave itself, where it was gathered in artificial
reservoirs that in ancient times furnished an adequate supply for
the inhabitants. One feature of these side canyons is that they enlarge
into basins surrounded on all sides by lofty cliffs. Many of these
basins are so hidden that they can be discovered only by following
dry stream-beds from their junction with the creeks. How many of
these basins are still undiscovered no one can yet tell. In these
basins now covered with bushes the aboriginal farms were probably
situated.</p>

<p>As the width of the valley of Laguna creek from Marsh pass to the
point where the stream receives its largest branches on the left bank
varies, the amount of arable land is greater in some places than in
others. In stretches where the stream almost washes the bases of
the ruins there could have been no extensive farming lands. The
creek meanders through the soft clay and sand which fill the valley
to the depth of many feet, forming treacherous banks that are continually
falling and changing the course of the stream, so it is quite
possible that the present configuration of the valley is very different
from what it was when the cliff-dwellings were inhabited. If the
occupants once had farms within its limits all traces of them would
have long since been obliterated. Although too much credence
should not be given to Navaho traditions, it is not unreasonable to
believe that in one particular at least they are correct. These state
that, before the introduction of sheep, grass was much higher in the
level part of the valley than at present, and formerly game (at least
the mountain sheep and the antelope) may have been more abundant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
This condition would have exerted a marked influence on the
life of the cliff-dwellers. Pictographs show that the ancient people,
either here or in their former homes, were familiar with these animals,
and various objects of bone and horn are significant in this
connection.</p>

<p>The Navaho National Monument (see sketch map, pl. <a href="#i089">22</a>) contains
two kinds of ruins,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> cliff-dwellings and pueblos. Most of the
latter are situated on promontories or on low hills. The structural
features of the cliff-dwellings are characteristic, their walls being constructed
of stone or adobe built against, rarely free from, vertical
faces of the cliff.</p>

<p>There are two types of kivas, one circular and subterranean, allied
to those of the Mesa Verde, the other rectangular, above ground,
entered from the sides.</p>

<p>The masonry of these northern ruins is crude, resembling that
of modern Walpi. The component stones are neither dressed nor
smoothed, but the walls are sometimes plastered. There is a great
similarity in architecture. No round towers<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> relieve the monotony or
impart picturesqueness to the buildings. The walls of ruined pueblos
in this region and the ceramic remains closely resemble those at
Black Falls on the Little Colorado. A prominent feature of the
walls is a <em>jacal</em> construction in which the mud is plastered on wattling
between upright poles. The ends of many of these supports project
high above the ground, constituting a characteristic feature of the
ruins. This method of wall construction is unknown at Black Falls
or at Walpi, but survives in modified form in one or more Oraibi
kivas and in one at least of the Mesa Verde ruins.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> It has been
described by Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff as common to several ruins in the
Canyon de Chelly.</p>

<p>The key to the culture of the people from which the cliff-dweller
culture was derived is probably the kiva, which furnishes also a good
basis for the classification of the Pueblos and cliff-dwellers into subordinate
groups.</p>

<p>Architecturally the kiva reached its highest development in the
Mesa Verde region, where it is a circular subterranean room with
pilasters and banquettes, ventilators and deflectors, fireplaces and
ceremonial openings, the features of which have been described elsewhere.
As we follow the San Juan down to its junction with the
Colorado we find a gradual simplification of the circular type of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>kiva by the elimination of pilasters, ventilators, and other features,
the round kiva being here represented by rooms in which almost
the only architectural feature remaining is the large banquette.
The question naturally arising in this connection is, whether the
circular kiva in the eastern region is a development of that simpler
form existing in the western or whether the latter is a degenerate
form of the eastern. In other words, does the evidence show that
this particular modification spread from the east down the San Juan
or from the west up the river to the east? In this connection it may
be urged that originally the form of circular kiva lacking pilasters
extended along the entire course of the San Juan and that the kivas
of the Mesa Verde became highly specialized forms in which pilasters
were developed, while those lower down the river remained the same.
We can not definitely answer either of these questions, but taken with
other evidence it would seem that the circular form of kiva originated
in the eastern section and gradually extended westward.</p>

<p>The modern Hopi rectangular form of ceremonial room situated
underground seems in some instances to have derived certain features
from the circular subterranean kiva.</p>

<p>The chief kiva at Walpi, that used by the Snake fraternity, is rectangular
and subterranean, while that used by the Flute priests, which
is practically a ceremonial room, is a chamber entered by a side doorway.
It is suggested that the Snake kiva at Walpi was derived from
the circular subterranean kiva of Tokónabi, the former home of the
Snake clan in northern Arizona, and that the Flute chamber was
developed from the rectangular rooms in the same ruins. The old
question, so often considered by Southwestern archeologists, whether
the circular subterranean kiva was derived from the rectangular or
<em>vice versa</em>, seems to the writer to be somewhat modified by the fact
that ceremonial rooms of both forms exist side by side in many
ancient cliff-dwellings. From circular subterranean kivas in some
instances developed square kivas, but the latter are sometimes the
direct development of square rooms; the determination of the original
form can best result from a study of clans and their migrations.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Naturally the questions one asks in regard to these ruins are:
Why did the inhabitants build in these cliffs? Who were the ancient
inhabitants? When were these dwellings inhabited and deserted?</p>

<p>It is commonly believed that the caves were chosen for habitations
because they could be better defended than villages in the open.
This is a good answer to the first question, so far as it goes, although
somewhat imperfect. The ancients chose this region for their homes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
on account of the constant water supply in the creek and the patches
of land in the valley that could be cultivated. This was a desirable
place for their farms. Had there been no caves in the cliffs they
would probably have built habitations in the open plain below.
They may have been harassed by marauders, but it must be borne
in mind that their enemies did not come in great numbers at any one
time. Defense was not the primary motive that led the sedentary
people of this canyon to utilize the caverns for shelter. Again, the
inroads of enemies never led to the abandonment of these great cliff-houses,
if we can impute valor in any appreciable degree to the
inhabitants. Fancy, for instance, the difficulty, or rather improbability,
of a number of nomadic warriors great enough to drive out the
population of Kitsiel, making their way up Cataract canyon and
besieging the pueblo. Such an approach would have been impossible.
Marauders might have raided the Kitsiel cornfields, but they
could not have dislodged the inhabitants. Even if they had succeeded
in capturing one house but little would have been gained, as
it was a custom of the Pueblos to keep enough food in store to last more
than a year. In this connection the question is pertinent, While hostiles
were besieging Kitsiel how could they subsist during any length
of time? Only with the utmost difficulty, even with aid of ropes
and ladders, can one now gain access to some of these ruins. How
could marauding parties have entered them if the inhabitants were
hostile? The cliff-dwellings were constructed partly for defense, but
mainly for the shelter afforded by the overhanging cliff, and the
cause of their desertion was not due so much to predatory enemies as
failure of crops or the disappearance of the water supply.</p>

<p>The writer does not regard these ruins as of great antiquity; some
of the evidence indicates that they are of later time. Features in
their architecture show resemblances derived from other regions.
The Navaho ascribe the buildings to ancient people and say that the
ruined houses existed before their own advent in the country, but
this was not necessarily long ago. Such evidence as has been
gathered supports Hopi legends that the inhabitants were ancient
Hopi belonging to the Flute, Horn, and Snake families.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that cliff-house architecture developed in
these canyons, and rude structures older than these have been
found in this region. Whoever the builders of these structures were,
they brought their craft with them. The adoption of the deflector
in the rectangular ceremonial rooms called kihus implies the derivation
of these rooms from circular kivas, and all indications are that
the ancient inhabitants came from higher up San Juan river.</p>

<p>Many of the ruins in Canyon de Chelly situated east of Laguna
creek show marked evidence of being modern, and they in turn are
not so old as those of the Mesa Verde. If the ruins become older as
we go up the river the conclusion is logical that the migration of the
San Juan culture was down the river from east to west, rather than
in the opposite direction. The scanty traditions known to the
author support the belief in a migration from east to west, although
there were exceptional instances of clan movements in the opposite
direction. The general trend of migration would indicate that the
ancestral home of the Snake and Flute people was in Colorado and
New Mexico.</p>

<p>It is evident from the facts here recorded that the ruins in the
Navaho National Monument contain most important, most characteristic,
and well-preserved prehistoric buildings, and that the
problems they present are of a nature to arouse great interest in
them. Having suffered comparatively little from vandalism, these
are among the best-preserved monuments of the cliff-dwellers’ culture
in our Southwest, and if properly excavated and repaired they
would preserve most valuable data for the future student of prehistoric
man in North America. It is not necessary to preserve all the
ruins within this area, but it would be well to explore the region
and to locate the sites of the ruins that it contains.</p>

<p>The writer has the honor to recommend that one of the largest two
cliff-dwellings in the Navaho National Monument, either Betatakin
or Kitsiel, be excavated, repaired, and preserved as a “type ruin”
to illustrate the prehistoric culture of the aborigines of this section
of Arizona; also that this work be supplemented by excavation and
repair of Inscription House, an ancient cliff-dwelling in West canyon.</p>

<p>He also recommends that one or more of the ruins in West canyon
be added to the Navaho National Monument and be permanently
protected by the Government.</p>
